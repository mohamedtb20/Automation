# Automation
  I'm a junior (cyber security and blockchain developer), and I find myself spending too much Mush Time on tasks does not bring me the value I mean repeated boring tasks that I can automate. While I'm studying python I find that I can automate a lot of things with it 
so I build this repository to share what I had done to save my time with Python.
